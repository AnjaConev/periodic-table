Description: Cadmium is a soft silvery-white metal that is chemically similar to zinc and mercury. It's probably a lot less famous though. :( 

It is a natural element found in tiny amounts in all soils and rocks, and it has been used to manufacutre batteries, pigments, metal coatings, and plastics.

There is a dark side to Cadmium, however. Occupational exposure to cadmium compounds is associated with an increase risk of lung cancer.
