Cesium is an alkali metal which is very pyrophoric and is known to explode upon being submerged in water, so be careful!

Caesium-based atomic clocks use the electromagnetic transitions in the hyperfine structure of caesium-133 atoms as a reference point. 
These atomic clocks are among the most accurate in the world.
